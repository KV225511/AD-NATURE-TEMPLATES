# AD-NATURE-TEMPLATES
Creating three add templates for practice purposes
HERE I HAVE CREATED A LIST OF ITEMS USING UNORDERED LIST .
I HAVE CREATED THREE LIST ITEMS AND INSIDE THAT ITEMS I HAVE CREATED A DIV.
INSIDE THE DIV I HAVE USED AN IMAGE FROM https://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/national-parks/best-view-in-every-national-park/?scope=anon. 
AND THEN I HAVE ADDED THE CONTENT.
LASTLY  I HAVE ADDED THE BUTTON WHICH REDIRECTS YOU TO THE ABOVE MENTIONED WEBSITE.
